  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      hunk's agent skill is installed at:
        #{opt_pkgshare}/skill
      Homebrew does not write into your home directory, so link it once into
      the cross-agent folder (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and most others read
      it) and into Claude Code's; every upgrade then moves both with the
      binary:
        mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills ~/.claude/skills
        ln -s #{opt_pkgshare}/skill ~/.agents/skills/hunk
        ln -s #{opt_pkgshare}/skill ~/.claude/skills/hunk
      If either destination is already a directory, remove it first.
