  # No `version` stanza. Homebrew scans it out of the release URL, and `brew
  # audit` refuses a declaration that agrees with what it already scanned:
  # "version 0.10.2 is redundant with version scanned from URL". gcp-cli.rb
  # declares one because its URLs name a bare binary with no version in it.

  # This is the full profile. Every release also carries jr-agent, jr-reader and
  # jr-ci, which are the same tool with capabilities compiled out rather than
  # switched off. They are deliberately not in this tap: the machine running
  # `brew install` belongs to a person, and the restricted profiles exist for
  # containers, which fetch the tarball directly.

      jr's agent skill is installed at:
        #{opt_pkgshare}/skill
      Homebrew does not write into your home directory, so link it once into
      the cross-agent folder (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and most others read
      it) and into Claude Code's; every upgrade then moves both with the
      binary:
        mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills ~/.claude/skills
        ln -s #{opt_pkgshare}/skill ~/.agents/skills/jr
        ln -s #{opt_pkgshare}/skill ~/.claude/skills/jr
      If either destination is already a directory, remove it first.
